This is a review of the Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 with an ARM processor, specifically the Snapdragon X Elite chip. The reviewer has spent several weeks using the device and shares their observations and thoughts on its performance, design, and features.

Here are some key points from the review:

* **Design and build quality**: The reviewer praises the laptop's all-metal design, keyboard, trackpad, and haptics. They also mention that the premium matte black finish is a nice touch.
* **Display**: The reviewer notes that the 2304x1536, 120Hz LCD touchscreen is not OLED, but still offers good brightness and color accuracy. However, they wish there was an OLED option available.
* **Performance**: The reviewer mentions that the ARM chip has many cores, but weaker individual performance on single-core basis. This means it's well-suited for tasks that utilize multiple cores, such as video editing or web browsing, but may not be ideal for demanding tasks like gaming.
* **Cooling and noise**: The reviewer notes that the laptop stays cool and quiet, even during intense usage.
* **Copilot feature**: The Surface Laptop 3 comes with a dedicated Copilot button on the keyboard, which allows users to interact with Microsoft's AI-powered assistant.
* **Software compatibility**: The reviewer emphasizes that the main question for potential buyers is whether their software of choice works on ARM. They encourage viewers to research this before making a purchase.

The review concludes by mentioning a unique feature from channel sponsor dbrand: an X-ray skin that allows users to see the internal components of their device using a special X-ray machine. The reviewer has used this product and finds it fascinating, but notes that it's not necessary for most users.

Overall, the review provides a balanced assessment of the Surface Laptop 3 with ARM processor, highlighting both its strengths and weaknesses.
